# RockPaperScissorLizardSpock

The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found. Almost always, the boys will all pick Spock at the same time and tie over and over again.

* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
